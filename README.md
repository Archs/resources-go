resources-go v1
===============

An assets-loading package for Go.

Applications can use this package to load assets from zip-files (incuding a zip file bundled in the executable),
the filesystem, or other sources through a single interface. Also allows for the building of a search path to access
files sequentially through a set of application defined locations.

This is the v1 version of the API, and should remain stable for the forseeable future. Access to the current version
as well as more recent stable versions can be found at: <https://github.com/cookieo9/resources-go>

 - Adjust the offsets in the zip header (optional) (zip -A myApp)
