resources-go
============

An assets-loading package for Go.

Applications can use this package to load assets from zip-files (incuding a zip file bundled in the executable),
the filesystem, or other sources through a single interface. Also allows for the building of a search path to access
files sequentially through a set of application defined locations.

 - Adjust the offsets in the zip header (optional) (zip -A myApp)
